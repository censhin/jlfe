jlfe Development
================


Goals
-----

Provide language infrastructure/support that will:

#. Make writing JVM-based LFE code succinct and elegant;

#. Make the interactions with Java objects, types, and data a seamless experience; and

#. Make LFE/Erlang hacking more alluring to adventurous Clojure hackers :-)

If these experiments prove to actually make wrting LFE+Erjang code easier
and more enjoyable (and more conceptually consistent), then discussions
will be opened on the LFE and Erjang mailing lists (as well as IRC) with
regard to:

#. The level of interest of these changes in the code bases of those
   projects,

#. Identifying the minimal set of changes necessary to provide the
   desired/acceptable functionality,

#. Contributing any patches to those projects that they would find
   acceptable.

If, however, these experiments are *unsuccessful*, who knows?
Perhaps more/different efforts to accomplish similar goals ...
